            "after many days’ journey, they came to towns, and cities, and to\r\n",
            "commonwealths, that were both happily governed and well peopled. Under\r\n",

            "either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and serpents,\r\n",
            "and some few men, that were neither less wild nor less cruel than the\r\n",
            "beasts themselves. But, as they went farther, a new scene opened, all\r\n",
            "things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more verdant, and\r\n",

            "got wonderfully into their favour by showing them the use of the\r\n",

            "before with great caution, and only in summer time; but now they count\r\n",
            "all seasons alike, trusting wholly to the loadstone, in which they are,\r\n",
